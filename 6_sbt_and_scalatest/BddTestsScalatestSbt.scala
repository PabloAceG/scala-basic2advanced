// Lesson on how to write Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD)

// Go to HelloScalaTest folder

// A few notes about this code:
// - It uses the FunSpec class where the TDD tests used FunSuite
// - A set of tests begins with describe
// - Each test begins with it. The idea is that the test should read like, “It
//   should do XYZ…,” where “it” is the double function
